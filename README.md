MovieeBag is using Movie DB api and various patterns/architechtures/frameworks/others.

## DESCRIPTION
It is a simple android application that consists of 4 pages
- Home Page (Now playing, popular, upcoming movies) with Search functionality
- Movie details page (Casting, similar movies, recommended movies, overview, revies and many more)
- Other pages (Take time to discover yourself)
- One can switch between Grid view to list view and having paging optimize the app to some extent.

I applied the MVVM design pattern I wrote with Kotlin, and tried to apply clean code rules.
